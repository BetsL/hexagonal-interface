Hexagon-style interface for the Stinger Sight Word Game: Hexagon style interface for the Stinger Sight Word Game: I thoroughly enjoyed combining several skills that resulted in this project - perspective, responsivity with a non-rectangular shape, lightbox creation, interval setting for effect and presentation - and loads more! I also wanted a color palette/design that spoke 'edtech'. 

Sight words are essential for young readers to know, but it can be tricky to make them engaging. I decided to make a digital resource that would introduce a little whimsy into knowledge that is usually relegated to flash cards. I tested the game out in the classroom to rave reviews then opted to add other 'levels' to peak interest. I would like to learn how to design the game in such a way that a player can move continuously from one level to another.
